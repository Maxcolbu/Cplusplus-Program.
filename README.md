    #Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
      The code I was given was PythonPython based. This included functions for training an AI agent to navigate a maze. This was tested through reinforcement learning, with a focus on deep Q learning. The code I added was strings that helped the agent perform. This also included changing the current code to implement the new functions.

        #What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
         Computer scientists play a pivotal role in our technological landscape. They study algorithms and data structures, leveraging this knowledge to tackle complex problems. Their work in software creation not only drives innovation but also paves the way for efficiency improvements. 
        #How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        I approach problems by overseeing each step. This allows me to see the whole task and how to break it down. This also allows for collaboration, which can help the developers enhance their projects and see different perspectives. 
        #What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        My ethical responsibilities are to ensure the systems' code integrity, security, and privacy. This will ensure the software is reliable and safe for any user. Understanding ethical concerns allows for trust and mitigation of users' data.
